# Sketches and schematics for `esp8266-section`

## Setup

1. Open Arduino IDE and from the menu bar go to `Tools > Manage Libraries`. Search for `ArduinoJson` and install the library called `ArduinoJson` by `BenoÃ®t Blanchon`. (`v6` is preferrable)

2. Again from the menu bar, go to `File > Preferences`. Now in the preferences window, input `https://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json` in the `Additional Boards Manager URLs` placeholder.

3. Select `NodeMCU 1.0 (ESP-12E Module)` as your `Board` and the right `Port` from the `Tools` bar.

4. Now you are all set up and good to go!
